# network
I designed a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users.
After the user login/register the home page will shown *All Posts* <img src="Images/Home.png" alt="Home page" /> <br>
User can type in the the box *What are you thinking about* to add a post, he will see all posts *(username, post content, date, like numbers)*, user is able to like/unlike posts, also edit and delete his own posts, a confirmation page will appear if user tried to delete his own post, and *edited* word will appear on edited post <br>
<img src="Images/Delete.png" alt="Delete confirmation" /> <img src="Images/Edit.png" alt="Edit page" /> <br>
If user clicked on the *username* in the post he will be redirected to the same user profile <br>
<img src="Images/Profile.png" alt="Profile" /> <br>
User can see numbers of followers, followings and number of posts that has been uploaded, also he can follow/unfollow other users. <br>
The *Following* tab in the navbar will show the user posts from people he follows only.
